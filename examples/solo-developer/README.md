# Solo Developer Example

This example shows a typical MSP workflow for a solo developer working on an API project.

## Scenario

You're building a REST API for a task management application. You use MSP to track your progress, decisions, and maintain context across sessions.

## Day 1: Project Setup

### Morning Session (9:00 AM)

```powershell
# Start your first session
.\msp.ps1 start --project "TaskAPI"

# MSP Response:
# üöÄ MSP Session Started
# Project: TaskAPI
# Progress: 0%
# No previous context found
```

### Setting up the project structure

```powershell
# Track initial setup
.\msp.ps1 update "Created Express.js project structure" 5
.\msp.ps1 update "Set up TypeScript configuration" 8
.\msp.ps1 decide "Using PostgreSQL - need relational data and ACID compliance"
.\msp.ps1 update "Configured ESLint and Prettier" 10
```

### Lunch Break (12:30 PM)

```powershell
# Always end sessions, even for breaks
.\msp.ps1 end --summary "Basic project setup complete"

# MSP Response:
# üéØ Session Complete!
# Duration: 3.5 hours
# Progress: 0% ‚Üí 10%
# Decisions: 1
# Updates: 3
```

### Afternoon Session (1:30 PM)

```powershell
# Resume work - MSP remembers everything
.\msp.ps1 start

# MSP Response:
# üöÄ MSP Session Started
# Project: TaskAPI
# Progress: 10%
# 
# üìù Previous Session:
# - Duration: 3.5 hours
# - Setup Express.js with TypeScript
# - Decision: PostgreSQL for database
#
# üí° Last activity: Configured linting
```

### Database Design

```powershell
# Continue from where you left off
.\msp.ps1 update "Designed database schema - users, tasks, projects" 15
.\msp.ps1 decide "Using UUID for IDs - better for distributed systems"
.\msp.ps1 update "Created Prisma schema and migrations" 20
.\msp.ps1 block "Prisma TypeScript types not generating correctly"

# Solved the blocker
.\msp.ps1 update "Fixed Prisma generation - needed to update config" 22
.\msp.ps1 resolve "Prisma generation issue - wrong output path in schema"
```

### End of Day

```powershell
.\msp.ps1 end --summary "Database layer complete, ready for API endpoints"

# Duration: 4 hours
# Progress: 10% ‚Üí 22%
# Decisions: 1
# Blockers: 1 (resolved)
```

## Day 2: API Development

### Morning Standup (9:00 AM)

```powershell
# Start new day - instant context
.\msp.ps1 start

# MSP Response:
# üöÄ MSP Session Started
# Project: TaskAPI  
# Progress: 22%
#
# üìä Project Summary:
# - Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma
# - Schema: Users, Tasks, Projects (UUID keys)
# - Next: Build API endpoints
#
# üí° Key Decisions:
# - PostgreSQL for ACID compliance
# - UUIDs for distributed compatibility
```

### Building Authentication

```powershell
.\msp.ps1 update "Implemented user registration endpoint" 28
.\msp.ps1 decide "Using bcrypt for password hashing - industry standard"
.\msp.ps1 update "Added JWT authentication middleware" 35
.\msp.ps1 decide "15-minute JWT expiry with refresh tokens - balance security/UX"
.\msp.ps1 update "Created login and refresh endpoints" 40
```

### Afternoon Progress

```powershell
.\msp.ps1 update "Built CRUD endpoints for tasks" 50
.\msp.ps1 update "Added pagination and filtering" 55
.\msp.ps1 block "Performance issue with task queries - N+1 problem"
```

## Day 3: Problem Solving

### Morning Session

```powershell
.\msp.ps1 start

# MSP shows the blocker immediately:
# ‚ö†Ô∏è Active Blocker: Performance issue with task queries - N+1 problem
# From: Yesterday 3:45 PM
```

### Solving the Performance Issue

```powershell
.\msp.ps1 update "Analyzing query performance with Prisma logging" 55
.\msp.ps1 update "Implemented query includes to prevent N+1" 58
.\msp.ps1 resolve "N+1 query issue - used Prisma include statements"
.\msp.ps1 decide "Always use explicit includes rather than lazy loading"
.\msp.ps1 update "Added query performance tests" 60
```

## Week 2: AI-Assisted Development

### Using Context with AI

```powershell
# Export context for AI assistance
.\msp.ps1 context --format ai | clip

# Now paste into Claude/ChatGPT:
# "Based on my project context, how should I implement task sharing between users?"

# AI Response (with context):
# "Given your PostgreSQL setup with UUID keys and JWT auth with 15-min expiry,
#  I recommend implementing task sharing through a join table with permissions..."
#  
# (AI understands your ENTIRE project, not just the current question)
```

### Implementing AI Suggestions

```powershell
.\msp.ps1 update "Created task_shares table based on AI recommendations" 65
.\msp.ps1 decide "Share permissions: view, edit, admin - simple but flexible"
.\msp.ps1 update "Implemented sharing endpoints with permission checks" 70
```

## Month Later: New Feature

### Instant Context Recovery

```powershell
.\msp.ps1 start

# Even after a month, MSP remembers everything:
# 
# üöÄ MSP Session Started
# Project: TaskAPI
# Progress: 85%
# Last Session: 2 weeks ago
#
# üèóÔ∏è Architecture:
# - PostgreSQL + Prisma + Express
# - JWT auth (15min + refresh)
# - UUID keys throughout
# - Task sharing with 3-level permissions
#
# üìà Recent Work:
# - Implemented real-time updates
# - Added email notifications
# - Created admin dashboard
#
# üí≠ Pending Decisions:
# - Payment integration approach
# - Mobile API versioning strategy
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Always Start and End Sessions** - Even for short breaks
2. **Track Decisions Immediately** - Your future self will thank you
3. **Small Progress Updates Matter** - 1% is still progress
4. **Blockers Are Learning Opportunities** - Track and resolve them
5. **Context Compounds** - Each session builds on the last

## The Power of MSP

After a month of using MSP:
- Zero time wasted remembering context
- Every decision is documented with rationale
- AI assistants are 10x more helpful
- Progress is visible and motivating
- Knowledge is never lost

## Try It Yourself

```powershell
# Start your own journey
.\msp.ps1 start --project "YourProject"

# The best time to start was at the beginning
# The second best time is now
```
