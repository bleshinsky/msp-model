## Coding Standards

### PowerShell Style Guide

- Use PascalCase for function names: `Start-MSPSession`
- Use camelCase for variable names: `$sessionId`
- Always include comment-based help for functions
- Use proper parameter validation
- Handle errors gracefully with try/catch

Example:
```powershell
function Start-MSPSession {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Starts a new MSP session
    .DESCRIPTION
        Initializes session tracking across all configured tools
    .PARAMETER Project
        The project name for this session
    .EXAMPLE
        Start-MSPSession -Project "MyAPI"
    #>
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$false)]
        [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
        [string]$Project = "Default"
    )
    
    try {
        # Implementation
    }
    catch {
        Write-Error "Failed to start session: $_"
        throw
    }
}
```

### Documentation Standards

- All public functions must have comment-based help
- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add examples for new features
- Keep documentation in sync with code

### Testing

- Write Pester tests for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Test on multiple platforms if possible
- Include integration tests for tool interactions
